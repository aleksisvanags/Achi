To set up the server side, open port 5050 (customisable in AchiServer.py) and allow the app through your firewall.
Then run AchiServer.py with AchiLogic.py and AchiCommonVariables.py in the same folder.

To set up the client side edit the 'SERVER' variable to the IP of the servers public IP (if on a different network to the server) or its local IP (if on the same network).
Then run AchiClient.py.
